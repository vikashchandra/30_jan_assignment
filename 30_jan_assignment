Q.5. Why and when to use while loop in python give a detailed description  with an example?
Ans - When we want a special block of code multiple times then we use ‘while loop’ in python. It is also known as the entry control loop. In this loop firstly, condition will be checked then block will be execute.If condition is true then block is executed, otherwise not.
syntax=>
		while  condition:
			Statement

Example:
	A program for print my name five time using while loop.

		a=1
		while a<=5:
			print(“vikash chandra pal \n”)
			a=a+1


Q.6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different patern.
Ans-
First  pattern:

a=1
while  a<=5:
	b=1
while  b<=a:
		print("*",end="  ")
		b=b+1
	print("  ")
  a=a+1

Second pattern:
a=5
while a>=1:
	b=1
	while b<=a:
print("*",end="  ")
b=b+1
	print("  ")
	a=a-1
 
Third pattern:
a=0
while a<=5:
	b=0
	while b<=a:
		print(b,end="  ")
		b=b+1
	print(" ")
	a=a+1
	 
Q.7. Reverse a while loop to display  numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans-  a=10
	    while  a>=1:
		  print(a)
		  a=a-1
